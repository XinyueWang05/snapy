# #289: the fourth-order x1 well-balanced face density of `dynamics/conversion-order: 4`

> `SNAP_WB_REF4` is gone: the face density below runs only with `dynamics/conversion-order: 4`
> (`src/hydro/wb_ref4.cpp`). Elsewhere the x1 face density is the x1 reconstruction's own linear rows on the cell
> density reference (weno5/cp5), with the kernel's face value as the fallback and for every other reconstruction.

This file derives the face density that `dynamics/conversion-order: 4` runs (until its removal it was also the switch
`SNAP_WB_REF4`, off unless set) step by step and states
the oracle it is tested against. The method is the face part of Jiheng's specification `wbref_exact_spec.md`
(taken from his derivation at c5b810d, which was not
available on any GitHub fork when this was written). The exact weights and identities used below are checked
by `docs/derivations/wb_ref4_weights.py` (sympy). The code is `src/hydro/wb_ref4.cpp`, called from
`HydroImpl::_hydro_ref_x1` (`src/hydro/hydro.cpp`).

Scope: Cartesian-exact. On spherical-polar and cubed-sphere grids the same index-space operators are applied
unchanged, which is not $r^2$-measure exact; that extension is a separate change.

## 0. Notation

- $z \equiv x_1$, gravity $g$ downward. Cell $i$ spans $[z_{i-1/2}, z_{i+1/2}]$ with width $\Delta z_i$; face $f$
  is the lower face of cell $f$. The owned cells are $i_s..i_u$.
- Ideal gas with $R_d = 1$ in the derivation, so $T = p/\rho$; $R \equiv \rho/p$.
- An overbar is a cell average; a subscript $f$ is a point value at a face.
- $\bar q = q + \tfrac{\Delta z^2}{24} q'' + O(\Delta z^4)$ for a smooth $q$ (cell average about the centre).
- $\mathcal I[\cdot]_f$: the face value the high-order (WENO5) reconstruction returns from cell averages of
  smooth data, to $O(\Delta z^5)$.

## 1. The base well-balanced x1 reconstruction

The solver reconstructs perturbations about a hydrostatic reference and restores the reference at the faces
(`hydro_forward.cpp`, step 2): $p' = \bar p - p_{\rm ref}$, $\rho' = \bar\rho - \rho_{\rm ref}$, even-parity
wall ghosts of $p'$ and $\rho'$, WENO5 of $p'$ and $\rho'$, then

$$
p^{L,R}_f = \widehat{p'}^{L,R}_f + p_{{\rm sf},f}, \qquad \rho^{L,R}_f = \widehat{\rho'}^{L,R}_f + \rho_{{\rm sf},f} .
$$

The kernel (`hydro_ref_x1_impl.h`) builds:

- **face pressure** by a top-down scan, $p_{{\rm sf},i-1/2} = p_{{\rm sf},i+1/2} + g\bar\rho_i\Delta z_i$: the
  discrete hydrostatic balance itself;
- **cell pressure** $p_{\rm ref}$: on a uniform grid the cell average of the quintic through six face
  pressures, $(11, -93, 802, 802, -93, 11)/1440$, one-sided rows at clamped walls; on a non-uniform grid the
  log-mean $\Delta p / \ln(p_{\rm lo}/p_{\rm hi})$;
- **cell density** $\rho_{{\rm ref},i} = p_{{\rm ref},i}\, r^s_i$, with $r_i = \bar\rho_i/\bar p_i$ smoothed by the
  binomial $B = (1, 4, 6, 4, 1)/16$ (edge replicated at a clamped wall);
- **face density** $\rho_{{\rm sf},f} = p_{{\rm sf},f}\,\tfrac12(r^s_{f-1} + r^s_f)$.

## 2. The base face-density offset is $O(\Delta z^2)$

Since the reconstruction treats $\rho'$ as cell averages, the face density it produces is

$$
\rho_f = \mathcal I[\bar\rho - \rho_{\rm ref}]_f + \rho_{{\rm sf},f} = \mathcal I[\bar\rho]_f + \delta\rho_f,
\qquad \delta\rho_f \equiv \rho_{{\rm sf},f} - \mathcal I[\rho_{\rm ref}]_f .
$$

So $\rho_f$ is a consistent high-order face value exactly when $\rho_{\rm sf}$ is the face value of the cell
field $\rho_{\rm ref}$ itself, whatever the accuracy of $\rho_{\rm ref}$. Step by step, for smooth $p$, $\rho$, $R$:

- Ratio of averages: $r_i = \bar\rho_i/\bar p_i = R_i + \tfrac{\Delta z^2}{24}(\rho'' - R p'')/p + O(\Delta z^4)$.
- Binomial bias: $B$ has unit sum and second moment $\sum_m m^2 w_m = 1$ (cells), so
  $B q = q + \tfrac{\Delta z^2}{2} q'' + O(\Delta z^4)$ and $r^s_i = r_i + \tfrac{\Delta z^2}{2}R''$.
- Kernel cell density, with $p_{\rm ref} = \bar p + c + O(\Delta z^6)$ (section 6): $\rho_{{\rm ref},i} = \bar\rho_i +
  \tfrac{\Delta z^2}{2} p R'' + O(\Delta z^4)$, so $\mathcal I[\rho_{\rm ref}]_f = \rho_f + \tfrac{\Delta z^2}{2} pR''$.
- Face reference: the mean of the two neighbouring cell values adds $\tfrac{\Delta z^2}{8}R''$, so
  $\rho_{{\rm sf},f} = p_f\big[R_f + \tfrac{\Delta z^2}{24}\tfrac{\rho'' - Rp''}{p} + \tfrac{\Delta z^2}{8}R'' + \tfrac{\Delta z^2}{2}R''\big]$.
- Subtract, with $\rho'' - Rp'' = 2p'R' + pR''$:

$$
\delta\rho_f = \frac{\Delta z^2}{12}\big(p'R' + 2pR''\big) + O(\Delta z^4).
$$

`wb_ref4_weights.py` (check 3) derives the same expression symbolically from exact cell averages of
quadratic $p$ and $R$ about the face. At a clamped wall, edge replication in $B$ is not exact even for linear
$r$, so the first two cells carry an $O(\Delta z)$ offset on top (a band of width $O(\Delta z)$).

**Where it enters.** The face pressure is untouched, so the offset enters only the x1 mass flux
$\bar u\rho_{L/R}$ at linear order, and through it the face gravity work ($-\tfrac g2(\delta F_{\rho,i-1/2} +
\delta F_{\rho,i+1/2})$ per cell). The energy flux $\bar u(\kappa p + \rho K)$ is independent of the face
density at linear order. The x2/x3 faces use the restored primitives, so this offset is separate from the
#289 x2 covariance term and adds to it.

## 3. The fix: face density as the face value of the kernel's cell density

The kernel's $\rho_{\rm ref}$ is kept. By section 2 only $\rho_{\rm sf}$ must change:

$$
\rho_{{\rm sf},f} = \mathcal I_4[\rho_{\rm ref}]_f \equiv P'(z_f),
$$

where $P$ is the quartic through the primitive values $P(z_{s+j}) = \sum_{k<j}\rho_{{\rm ref},s+k}\Delta z_{s+k}$,
$j = 0..4$ (five faces enclosing four cells), window $s = f - 2$, kept inside the owned cells at a clamped
wall. The weight of cell $s+k$ is $\Delta z_{s+k}\sum_{j>k}L_j'(z_f)$ with $L_j$ the Lagrange basis on the five
faces; this uses physical spacing and is exact for cubic point profiles on any grid. On a uniform grid
(check 2):

- interior: $(-1, 7, 7, -1)/12$;
- wall face, window starting at the wall: $(25, -23, 13, -3)/12$;
- the next face: $(3, 13, -5, 1)/12$ (and their mirror images at the top).

Then $\delta\rho_f = \mathcal I_4[\rho_{\rm ref}]_f - \mathcal I[\rho_{\rm ref}]_f = O(\Delta z^4)$, and the face
density the solver uses is $\mathcal I[\bar\rho]_f + O(\Delta z^4)$.

## 4. Ordering

The resolution flag (section 7) is built right after the kernel. The face part runs after the x1 seam
ghost-row exchange of $(p_{\rm ref}, \rho_{\rm ref})$, so a column split along x1 gets the same faces as one
block (`test_x1_seam_split_co4_face_density`, and across two ranks `test_x1_seam_split_mp_co4_face_density`:
plm at conversion-order 4 on a cold column).

## 5. Non-uniform x1 grids: the cell pressure

A keyed stretched x1 (`cells/x1rat` or `geometry/x1f`, #280) already has a
sixth-order cell pressure: the cell average of the degree-5 interpolant through six faces, built from the
widths (#280 (iv)). There the switch keeps it, so REF4 contributes only the face density of section 3,
and `balance_column` does not run REF4: the stretched rest state is the
same with the switch on or off. On a keyed
stretched family the measured order of $N^2_{\rm eff}$ is 4.06/4.04 (1 e-fold) and 3.78/3.89 (3 e-folds) at
$h_{\max}/h_{\min} = 4$. On a Cartesian x1 `SNAP_X1_CENTROID_EXACT` has no content of its own (it no longer turns this face
density on).

## 6. Exact discrete balance is kept

At rest $p' = $ const, so $p_L = p_R = p_{\rm sf} + c$, $\bar u = 0$ and the LMARS face pressure is
$p_{\rm sf} + c$; the momentum-flux difference across cell $i$ is $g\bar\rho_i\Delta z_i$ and cancels the gravity
source exactly. The density reference is not part of this pairing: with $\bar u = 0$ the mass flux and the
face gravity work vanish whatever the face density is. The fix never changes $p_{\rm sf}$ or $p_{\rm ref}$, so
the discrete rest state $\bar p = p_{\rm ref} + c$ is the base's.

Why $p_{\rm ref} = \bar p + c + O(\Delta z^6)$ on a hydrostatic background: the scan gives
$p_{{\rm sf},i-1/2} - p_{{\rm sf},i+1/2} = g\bar\rho_i\Delta z_i = \int_{\rm cell} g\rho\,dz$ exactly, so the scan
faces are the exact face pressures up to one column constant $c$ (the top anchor); the six-face quadrature
then has error $O(\Delta z^6)$. The constant changes $\rho_{\rm ref}$ by the smooth $cR$, which section 3
carries consistently because the face value is taken of the same $\rho_{\rm ref}$.

## 7. Guards

A guarded face keeps the kernel's value. None fires on a resolved smooth column.

- Range: $\mathcal I_4[\rho_{\rm ref}]_f$ outside $[\min, \max]$ of $\rho_{\rm ref}$ in its two neighbouring cells,
  with a relative margin $10^{-10}$, keeps the kernel's face value.
- Resolution: a cell with $\lvert\ln(p_{{\rm sf},i-1/2}/p_{{\rm sf},i+1/2})\rvert > 0.5$ (fewer than two cells per
  pressure scale height) is flagged, the flag is dilated by two cells, and ghost cells past a clamped wall do
  not count. Faces next to a flagged cell keep the kernel's face value.
- Seams: each block computes the flag from its own scan pressures, ghost cells included, and the flag is not
  exchanged. The flag of a cell or a seam face reads $p_{\rm sf}$ at most three cells away, so with nghost
  $\ge 3$ (checked at setup) the two sides of an x1 seam agree, except at an exact tie
  $\lvert\ln(p_{{\rm sf},i-1/2}/p_{{\rm sf},i+1/2})\rvert = 0.5$, where the two scans' last-ulp difference can
  put the cell on either side (`test_x1_seam_split_co4_face_density`: the flag switching on next to a seam).
- A block with a clamped wall and fewer than four owned cells keeps the kernel's reference. Its stencil cache
  is then "not usable" and holds no weights, so the check that rebuilds the cache for another device or dtype
  (`WbRef4Stencils::stale`) never reads them; before #298 it read the device of the undefined weight tensor and
  the second RK stage threw (`tests/test_stencil_cache_small_block.py`: nx1 2–5 per block now run).

The threshold, the dilation and the margin are design choices, not derived.

## 8. The oracle

Cartesian, one-step, linear. Neutral polytrope with $\gamma = 5/3$, $m = 1/(\gamma-1)$, $g = m+1$:
$T_0 = 1 + L_z - z$, $\rho_0 = T_0^m$, $p_0 = T_0^{m+1}$; the column is $n$ pressure e-folds deep,
$L_z = e^{n/(m+1)} - 1$; $L_x = 2L_z$, $n_x = 2n_z$; reflecting x1 walls, periodic x2, WENO5, LMARS, face
gravity work, the #289 flux covariance on.

- Mode, seeded as momentum: $\rho_0 v_1 = Ak\sin(qz)\cos(kx)$, $\rho_0 v_2 = -Aq\cos(qz)\sin(kx)$,
  $q = \pi/L_z$, $k = 2\pi/L_x$, $A = 10^{-4}$.
- Cell-average IC: exact cell averages (4x4 Gauss-Legendre) of $\rho$, $m_1$, $m_2$ and $E$; primitives
  $\bar\rho$, $\bar m/\bar\rho$, $\bar p = (\gamma-1)(\bar E - \lvert\bar m\rvert^2/2\bar\rho)$.
- One RK3 step at $\Delta t = 0.3\Delta z/\sqrt{\gamma T_{\rm bottom}}$; with $s = \ln(p\rho^{-\gamma})$ from the
  end-of-step conserved state, $\delta s_i = [(s^1 - s^0)_{\rm mode} - (s^1 - s^0)_{\rm rest}]/\Delta t$.
- $N^2_{\rm eff} = \tfrac g\gamma \sum_i(-\delta s_i)w_i / \sum_i w_i^2$, $w = v_1$ at $t = 0$, all interior cells.
  Reported as $N^2_{\rm eff}n_z^2$; the order is that of $\lvert N^2_{\rm eff}\rvert$ itself between doublings.

**No diagnostic floor.** $\nabla\cdot m = 0$ pointwise, so $\partial_t\bar\rho = 0$ exactly. The linear energy
tendency is $-\nabla\cdot(\kappa p_0 v) - g m_1 = -\kappa\, m\cdot\nabla T_0 - g m_1 = (\kappa - g)m_1 = 0$, since
$p_0v = T_0 m$, $T_0' = -1$ and $\kappa = \gamma/(\gamma-1) = g$. So the exact cell-average tendencies vanish at
linear order and every measured $\delta s$ is scheme error, at every depth.

## 9. Results

Code at the commit that adds this file (src unchanged since 1454878), CPU Release build. "off" = switch
unset, bitwise equal to 8cea3ae (the pre-rebase head of #293, merged to main as aea71ed); "on" = `SNAP_WB_REF4=1`. $N^2_{\rm eff}n_z^2$ at $n_z$ = 64 / 128 / 256 and the
observed order $p$ of $\lvert N^2_{\rm eff}\rvert$. These numbers, and those of section 5, predate #339, which
dropped the switch's cell density part. The face-only values at 3 e-folds are in `tests/test_wb_ref4_order.py`.

| depth | off (RED) | $p$ off | on (GREEN) | $p$ on | spec, on |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 e-fold | +0.1090 / +0.0873 / +0.0756 | 2.32, 2.21 | -0.0707 / -0.0358 / -0.0180 | 2.98, 2.99 | -0.071 / -0.036 / -0.018 |
| 2 e-folds | +0.2921 / +0.2656 / +0.2485 | 2.14, 2.10 | -0.1172 / -0.0604 / -0.0306 | 2.96, 2.98 | -0.119 / -0.061 / -0.031 |
| 3 e-folds | +0.5870 / +0.5598 / +0.5326 | 2.07, 2.07 | -0.2257 / -0.1194 / -0.0614 | 2.92, 2.96 | -0.235 / -0.122 / -0.062 |
| 5 e-folds | +1.5600 / +1.7330 / +1.7072 | 1.85, 2.02 | -0.9454 / -0.5492 / -0.2961 | 2.78, 2.89 | -1.046 / -0.580 / -0.305 |

Off, $N^2_{\rm eff}n_z^2$ tends to a constant (order 2); on, it falls like $\Delta z$ (order of $N^2_{\rm eff}$
about 3). The base column agrees with the spec's base column to the printed digits at 1 e-fold (+0.109 / +0.087 /
+0.076), within 2% at 2 and 3 e-folds, and within 7% at 5 e-folds ($n_z$ 64: +1.560 against +1.458); the
differences are not diagnosed (the spec's base is main 117e449, this one 8cea3ae, #293 before its rebase to main aea71ed).

Split into the 3 cells at each wall ("band") and the rest ("interior"), same denominator, on:

| depth | band, on | interior, on | interior, off |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 e-fold | -0.0711 / -0.0359 / -0.0180 | +0.0003 / +0.0001 / +0.0000 | +0.0590 / +0.0622 / +0.0631 |
| 5 e-folds | -0.9363 / -0.5452 / -0.2950 | -0.0091 / -0.0039 / -0.0011 | +0.9107 / +1.3099 / +1.4813 |

The interior offset is removed; what is left is the order-3 wall band, as in the spec. Its source is not
identified (hypothesis: the even-parity perturbation ghosts or the reflecting-wall reconstruction; the spec
finds it mostly present with the covariance off and in the base too).

Linearity: at $2A$, 1 e-fold, $n_z$ 64 / 128, on: -0.070748 / -0.035790 against -0.070749 / -0.035792 at $A$.

The ctest `test_wb_ref4_order` ran this oracle at 1 and 3 e-folds, $n_z$ 32 / 64 / 128, and asserted, at the last
doubling, order $\ge 2.75$ with the switch and $< 2.5$ without it, and a switched $\lvert N^2_{\rm eff}\rvert$
at $n_z$ 32 at least 10 times below the unswitched one. With the switch gone it runs the default only (the face
density from the reconstruction's linear rows) and asserts order $\ge 2.75$ at the last doubling.

## 10. Tests that pin the kernel's reference

Both ran unchanged with the switch off and a second time with it set (the `*_wb_ref4` ctests, removed with
the switch):

- `test_balance_column`: the switch changes no cell pressure, so the balanced columns are the kernel's.
- `test_face_floor`: the kernel's cell density does not follow the dipped cell, with or without the switch,
  so the floor fires on the same face and the fluxes there equal the switch-off values.

## 11. Not covered

- The $r^2$-measure (spherical-polar, cubed-sphere) version of sections 3-5.
- Multi-species columns use the dry-density channel, as the kernel does; untested with the switch.
- Multi-process x1 seams are covered only by the in-process split test.
